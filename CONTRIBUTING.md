# Contributing to Lyng

Thanks for checking out Lyng! We'd love for you to contribute. Whether
you're a first-time open source contributor or an experienced developer, there
are ways you can help make Lyng great!

## Filing Issues

If you have a bug to report or a feature to suggest, please do so on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Bojanni050/lyng/issues). Use the issue templates,
follow any instructions they contain, and search for existing issues —
*including closed ones!* If someone has already reported a bug or requested
the feature you have in mind, add a 👍 to it. Issues with more reactions are
more likely to be addressed.

For bugs, please verify that you're running the latest version of Lyng and
include your platform, app version and relevant log output. If you file an
issue without providing detail, we may close it without comment.

## Triaging Issues

Another way to help is to reproduce bug reports, confirm feature requests,
and point newcomers in the right direction. If you're good at testing and
addressing issues, we'd love your help!

## Contributing Code

One of the best ways is to grab a bug report or feature suggestion that has
been labelled `accepted` or `help-wanted` and dig in.

Please be wary of working on issues *not* marked as `accepted`. Just because
someone has created an issue doesn't mean we'll accept a pull request for it.
If the issue you want to work on is not labelled, leave a comment asking
whether an external contribution will be considered.

You can also help implement *any* feature by creating a **plugin** for it!
If you need inspiration, look through the open feature requests, especially
anything marked `for-plugin`.

### Pull requests

Before submitting, run `npm run lint` (prettier + eslint) and make sure the
CI checks pass. Keep pull requests focused: one clear change per PR is much
easier to review.

# Build and Run From Source

If you want to understand how Lyng works or want to debug an issue,
you'll want to get the source, build it, and run it locally.

## Installing Prerequisites

You'll need git and a recent version of Node.JS (v20 LTS is recommended and is
what CI uses; v16.17+ with npm v8+ is the minimum). [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
is also highly recommended. Based on your platform, you'll also need:

**Windows:**

- `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`

**OS X:**

- Python
- Xcode and the Command Line Tools (Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads), which
  will install `gcc` and the related toolchain containing `make`.

**Linux:**

- Python v2.7
- make
- A proper C/C++11 compiler tool chain, for example GCC
- Library dependencies:
  - On Debian-based Linux: `sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxkbfile-dev execstack libgconf-2-4 libsecret-1-dev`
  - On Red Hat-based Linux: `sudo yum install libX11-devel.x86_64 libxkbfile-devel.x86_64 libsecret-1-dev libsecret-devel`.

After you have these tools installed, run the following commands to check out
Lyng, install dependencies, and launch the app:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bojanni050/lyng
cd lyng
npm install
npm start
```

### The mailsync binary

Lyng's sync engine ([mailsync](https://github.com/Bojanni050/Mailspring-Sync),
inherited from Mailspring) is a separate C++ program that the app spawns per
account. You don't need to build it: `npm install` prints a reminder if the
engine is missing, and `npm run fetch-mailsync` downloads this fork's prebuilt
`mailsync` binary for your platform from the [Mailspring-Sync release
page](https://github.com/Bojanni050/Mailspring-Sync/releases) and unpacks it
into `./app`. Upstream Mailspring prebuilts deliberately don't work here: they
carry a path gate that a renamed build cannot satisfy. If you've checked out
the submodule (`git submodule update --init`) in order to work on the sync
engine, build and install it yourself; remove the submodule checkout and re-run
`npm run fetch-mailsync` to go back to the prebuilt binary.

## Development Workflow

### App Data

When you're running Lyng with `npm start`, it runs with the `--dev` flag
and user data is located in a `Lyng-dev` folder alongside the regular
settings folder:

- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Lyng-dev`
- Windows: `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\Lyng-dev`
- Linux: `~/.config/Lyng-dev/`

### Developer Tools

From Lyng, you can open the Developer Tools from the
menu: `Menu > Developer > Toggle Developer Tools`. Here are a few tips for
getting started:

- Errors and warnings will show in the console.

- On the console, `$m` is a shorthand for `mailspring-exports`, and allows you
  to access global `Stores` and `Model` classes.

- You don't need to stop and restart the development version of Lyng
  after each change. You can just reload the window via `CTRL+R` (Windows/Linux)
  or `CMD+R` (macOS).

### Linting

We use `prettier` and `eslint` for linting our sources. You can run both of
these by running `npm run lint` on the command line. Always do this before
submitting a pull request to ensure the CI servers accept your code.

### Documentation

Back in 2015 and 2016, the Nylas Mail team made a huge effort to document
the codebase. The plugin SDK docs live in
[`app/build/docs_src/`](app/build/docs_src/SUMMARY.md) and are still largely
relevant to Lyng development.

### Testing Localization

You can run the app in different localizations by passing a langauge code to
Electron via `--lang=de`. To use this in conjunction `npm start`, you'll need
to use the `--` argument forwarding syntax: `npm start -- --lang=de`.

# Where to Contribute

There are several reasons a pull request for the core mail client may not be
accepted, like:

- **Maintainability** - We're _extremely_ wary of adding options and preferences
  for niche behaviors. Email is a wild west, and we can't afford to support
  every possible configuration. Our general rule is that the code complexity
  of adding a preference isn't worth it unless the users are fairly evenly
  divided about the desired behavior.

- **User experience** - We want to deliver a lightweight and smooth mail
  client, so UX and performance matter a lot. If you'd like to change or
  extend the UI, consider doing it in a plugin or theme.

- **Architectural** - Architectural changes need to be agreed upon in the
  issue first, especially things like new extension APIs. To improve the
  chances to get a pull request merged you should select an issue that is
  labelled with the help-wanted or bug labels.

In short, if the issue you want to work on is not labelled with `accepted`,
start a conversation on that issue first.

# Code of Conduct

In order to keep the conversation clear and transparent, please limit
discussion to English and keep things on topic with the issue. Be considerate
to others and try to be courteous and professional at all times.
